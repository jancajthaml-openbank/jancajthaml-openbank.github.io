# Introduction

OpenBank project aims to solve the problem with virtual account management and value transfer in hybrid deployment environment neither pursuing classical bank cores nor crypto approaches but learning from both.

In classical core banking systems the system is usually implemented with store procedures or database kernel modules to guarantee acidity of data.
In crypto systems on other hand the problem of value transfer is postponed with RSA and immutable audit log called blockchain.

## Value transfer in classical bank core

## Value transfer in crypto based bank core

> TBD separate into its own doc explaining step by step how classical bank is implemented

Both of these approaches are "wall-to-wall" and none of those provide stable sustainable and constant behaviour that does not degrade with number of accounts, number of transfers or size of the mesh.

This project aims to solve that with focusing and "reinventing" approaches step by step building foundational and extensible solution that is distributed, trustful, scaleable and can run unattended for several years of decades by design.

It contains of three services focusing on core value transfer usecase and three services showing example of specific usecases.
