# REST

The best way to understand how REST works is by thinking on a RESTful Web Service. The Web Service will expose its functionality through HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) that can be used by the client to perform requests.

RESTful service is defined by resource that it wants to expose, that resource defines the URL that you will use to access the resource, and the HTTP methods that will be used to perform requests.
