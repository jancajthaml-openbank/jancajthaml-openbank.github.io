# GraphQL

GraphQL is a declarative, strongly typed language for requesting and manipulating data developed by Facebook in 2012.

You can use GraphQL to query data from a server in the form of a JSON object. The GraphQL query consists of fields and objects. A field is the name of something you want to retrieve from the server. An object is a name/value pair that describes the field.
